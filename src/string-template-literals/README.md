This tutorial is for es 6 template literals.

Basically, Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can have multiline template literals as well.

```
Example: 

let name = 'bob';
let template = `${name} is great !!`;

```

Multiline template literals is similar.
```
let name = 'bob';
let city = 'san jose';

let template = `${name} is great !! 
and he works in ${city}`

```
